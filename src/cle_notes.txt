+ Return graph: needs scores? (get_return_graph) - DONE
+ Scores in max_heads / y_graph / return_graph ? - DONE
+ new_graph: remove cycle nodes from dependents of out-cycle nodes - DONE
+ return_graph excludes nodes that are not max_head of any other token + nodes without dependents
    add keys anyway with empty dict? - DONE


To do / consider:
+ include graph_ob as argument / global graph_ob ??
+ dict keys (nodes) as str or int?
+ add edges not involved in cycle in a function ? (repeated)
+ nicer expression for node_head_of_vc
+ nodes with no dependents as keys with {} required/useful?
