Create templates

Apply templates to training data (fill in with all possibilities)
    => Create feature map:
        one per file (training data)
        e.g. index 0: hform is 'hello'
                    1: hpos is NN
                    ...
input: train file
output: dict (feature map)

Create feature vectors of samples in dev/test set
Give values 0/1 for each feature
input: sentence from dev/test + feature map
output: feature vector


+ distance and direction of ROOT
+ direction: right/left or R/L or else?
+ comma in between elements of feature?


to do:
+ add features with words in between head and dep
+ add other features not in paper
+ correct distance? if two tokens are next to each other, is the distance 1 or 0? (now 1)
+ between: repeating pos
    no new feature is added because it already exists in feature map
    but how are multiple tokens represented?
+ which feature corresponds to which template?
    now that info is lost

Very sparse:
+ if distance > 20 -> just have feature that says 20+
+ use lemma features?
+ keep lemma and don't use form?
